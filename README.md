# PREDICTIVE-MAINTENANCE-FOR-AIRCRAFT-ENGINES
This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance system for aircraft engines, leveraging machine learning techniques to predict potential engine failures before they occur. By using historical sensor data, the project seeks to analyze engine performance and detect early signs of malfunction, allowing maintenance teams to act proactively.
